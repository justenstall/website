# Biography

I am a Data Science Engineer at the University of Dayton Research Institute (UDRI). I work for [ACT3](https://www.afrl.af.mil/ACT3/), a machine learning/artificial intelligence research team within the Air Force Research Lab.

## Portfolio

### Hops

[Hops](https://github.com/act3-ai/hops) is a Homebrew Bottle installer with a focus on performance and mobility.

I worked on Hops as a research project during the final semester of my CS master's program. I was inspired by the release of Astral's [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) and my experience at ACT3 using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) to distribute internal software to the ACT3 team and other developers throughout the Air Force (the [Homebrew tap](https://github.com/act3-ai/homebrew-tap) is hosted on GitHub).

### ACT3 Project Tool

I built "Project Tool" (`act3-pt`) for ACT3. The `act3-pt` CLI is a project management tool that can bootstrap projects from a "Blueprint", creating files and also configuring the project's GitLab settings to enable CI/CD and secure the repository. Project Tool can also update existing projects when their "Blueprint" has been updated, using a Git three-way-merge inspired by [KPT](https://kpt.dev/).

An open source fork of the project is available on GitLab.
