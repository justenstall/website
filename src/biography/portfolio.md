## Hops

[Hops](https://github.com/act3-ai/hops) is a Homebrew Bottle installer with a focus on performance and mobility.

I worked on Hops as a research project during the final semester of my CS master's program. I was inspired by the release of Astral's [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) and my experience at ACT3 using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) to distribute internal software to the ACT3 team and other developers throughout the Air Force (the [Homebrew tap](https://github.com/act3-ai/homebrew-tap) is hosted on GitHub).
