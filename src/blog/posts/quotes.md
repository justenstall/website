# Quotes

From [The Brain Dump](https://floooh.github.io/2018/06/02/one-year-of-c.html):

> ## Less Language Feature ‘Anxiety’
>
> This is also a bit strange, but I feel more calm and focused when writing C code. Again this is something that I would never have noticed without starting to write C again. When writing C++ there’s always more than one way to do something and many micro-decisions need to happen:
>
> Do I wrap this concept in a class or are namespaced functions better? Does the class need constructors? Does it need a copy constructor? Multiple copy constructors? A move constructor? What constructors need to be explicit? What type of initializations make sense? Initializer lists? Constructors with default parameters? Multiple overloaded constructors? Geez, and that’s just for the initialization topic…
>
> As a C++ programmer I developed my own pet-coding-patterns and bad behaviours (e.g. make methods or destructors virtual even if not needed, create objects on the heap and manage them through smart pointers even if not needed, add a full set of constructors or copy-operators, even when objects weren’t copied anywhere, and so on). All of this is obviously bad, but it’s some sort of automatic coping mechanism to deal with the complexity of C++.
>
> Since C is such a simple language, most of those micro-decisions simply don’t exist once your mind has tuned itself to do things the C way instead of trying to write C++ code in C.
>
> When writing C code I have the impression that each line of code does something useful, and I worry less about having selected the right language feature.
